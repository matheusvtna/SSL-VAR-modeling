__(SSL VAR and SSL Game Component Diagrams)__

This repository contains the AstahUML file with associated classes for the SSL VAR and SSL Game component diagrams. These diagrams depict the architecture of the SSL VAR and SSL Game systems. The diagrams follow an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, with a web interface serving as the view, a controller with a facade pattern, and various services and classes representing the model.

## Services
### VisionService
The `VisionService` component is responsible for receiving vision data from an external subsystem called SSLVision. It establishes communication with SSLVision through UDP, utilizing the Protobuf format to transmit data. The primary message produced by this service is a `Frame` object, encapsulating information about the detected ball, teammates, and opponents.

### RefereeService
The `RefereeService` component handles the reception of referee data from an external subsystem called GameController. It establishes a UDP-based communication link with GameController, leveraging Protobuf for data serialization. Additionally, it communicates with the `VisionService` to obtain the current processed `Frame` value. The resulting message generated by this service is a `Referee` object, containing relevant game status information.

### StrategyService
The `StrategyService` component retrieves vision and referee data from the `VisionService` and `RefereeService`, respectively, using ZeroMQ for communication. It processes the received data and formulates a strategic plan for the team's players. The outcome of this service is a `Strategy` object, encapsulating the determined strategy.

### CommunicationService
The `CommunicationService` component is responsible for obtaining the strategy data produced by the `StrategyService` and constructing a packet to be sent to the robot via the BaseStation subsystem. It facilitates the delivery of the calculated strategy to the robot.

## Components

## SSL VAR Component Diagram

The SSL VAR component diagram illustrates the following components:

### SSL Game Component Diagram

The SSL Game component diagram expands upon the SSL VAR diagram and introduces the following components:

## Protobuf Messages

The model incorporates the following Protobuf messages defined within their respective classes:

### Vision.proto
The `Vision.proto` file defines the Protobuf message structures for vision-related data. It includes messages such as `Ball`, `Robot`, `Field`, and `Frame`, which encapsulate information about the position, velocity, and other relevant attributes of detected objects within the robot soccer field.

### Referee.proto
The `Referee.proto` file defines the Protobuf message structures for referee-related data. It follows the specifications provided by the RoboCup SSL for representing referee information during the game.

## Custom Classes

In addition to the Protobuf messages, the model incorporates the following custom classes:

### Behavior
The `Behavior` class represents behavior-related data. It includes attributes such as `vx` (velocity in the x-axis), `vy` (velocity in the y-axis), and `vw` (angular velocity). Instances of this class describe the desired behavior of the robot.

### Tactic
The `Tactic` class represents a specific tactic associated with a robot and its corresponding behavior. It includes attributes such as `robot` (representing the associated robot) and `behavior` (representing the desired behavior for the tactic).

### Play
The `Play` class represents a sequence of tactics employed during the game. It consists of a list of `Tactic` objects, defining the tactics to be executed in a specific order.

### Strategy
The `Strategy` class encapsulates the overall strategy for the game. It incorporates the current `Frame` data, the referee information (`Referee`), and the selected `Play` to guide the team's behavior and decision-making during the match.

### RobotPacket
The `RobotPacket` class represents a packet of data to be transmitted to the robot. It includes a `data` attribute that holds the packet's content as a string.
